OVERVIEW: Glass microscope slides (76.2 mm x 25.4 mm x 1 mm) are epoxied (J.B. Weld) to the front and back of the device for in situ imaging.

MAIN PART DESCRIPTION:
* 1cell_PBME_REa - Flow cell containing slits for two electrodes. The channel width is 2 cm. Two glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device for in situ imaging. There is a port for a miniature reference electrode.
* 1cell_PBME_REc - Flow cell containing slits for two electrodes. The channel width is 2 cm. Two glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device for in situ imaging. There is a port for a miniature reference electrode.
* 1cell_PBME - Flow cell containing slits for two electrodes. The channel width is 2 cm. Two glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device for in situ imaging.
* 4cell_PBME - Flow cell containing slits for eight electrodes. The channel width is 2 cm. Glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device for in situ imaging.
* H2_gasmanifold - H2 gas manifold with two liquid flow-through channels and three gas channels.

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS REQUIRED:
* Epoxy
* Glass microscope slides
* Ag/CP electrodes
* PtRu GDE electrodes

ASSEMBLY:
1) Print out the cell and the H2 gas manifold.
2) Epoxy the PtRu GDE on the gas manifold, and only cover the three gas channels with the PtRu GDE. 
3) Insert the electrodes into the slits on the sides of the device and epoxy into place. The gap between the electrode and the front window is 3 mm, and it is 1 mm between the electrode and the back window.
4) Epoxy the glass windows to the front and back of the device.
