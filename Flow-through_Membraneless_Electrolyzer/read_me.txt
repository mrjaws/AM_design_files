OVERVIEW: A glass window is epoxied (J.B. Weld) to the backside of the body of the electrolysis cell to allow for backlighting and improved contrast for high speed video experiments. A 2 mm wide separator tab is inserted into the device to split the channel into two equal streams. A Viton gasket is inserted above and below the tab to ensure a mechanical seal when the device is clamped shut. A 0.25 inch thick glass sheet is clamped to the front of the device to allow for visual observation with a high speed camera.

MAIN PART DESCRIPTION:
* Variable Tab Cell - Flow cell containing slots for two electrodes. A glass window must be epoxied to the backside of the device to allow for backlighting.
* Tab with 2 mm Tip - The separator tab is inserted into the cell to split the channel into two equal streams.
* Clamps - The front side window is clamped to the body of the cell with two clamps. A Viton gasket is inserted between the cell body and the front side window to ensure a mechanical seal when the device is clamped shut.

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS REQUIRED:
* Epoxy
* 0.25 inch thick glass sheet
* Titanium mesh electrodes
* Viton rubber gasket
* Clamp screws

ASSEMBLY:
1) Print out all parts
2) Cut a piece of glass to the size of the backside window
2) Epoxy the glass window to the backside of the device
3) Insert the electrodes into slots in the side of the cell and epoxy into place
4) Cut two Viton rubber gaskets of desired thickness to the size of the separator tab
5) Insert the tab into the body of the cell with the Viton gaskets above and below it
6) Cut a piece of glass to the size of the frontside window
7) Cut a Viton rubber gasket of desired thickness to the size of the contact area between the cell body and the front side window
8) Sand / smoothen the area of the cell body that contacts with the frontside glass window
9) Insert the Viton gasket between the body of the cell and the frontside glass window
10) Put one clamp below the cell body, and put the other clamp above the frontside glass window. Clamp the frontside glass window to the cell body by screwing
