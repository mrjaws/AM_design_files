Overview: Floating PV electrolysis module 

MAIN PART DESCRIPTION:
*BODY_FINAL_12_19 -- Main body of the electrolysis cell. Contains slotted rails for two cathode/anode pairs. Opposite of each electrode pair is a slot for a viewing window to be epoxied in for viewing. The top of the body contains four connecting points to make a snap fit to the inner tube. The dimensions of the top of the body are such that the lid component should be able to fit snugly.
* INNER_TUBE_12_19 -- Inner tube structure designed to be printed with low infill, allowing for electrolyzer to float when placed in an electrolyte reservoir. Bottom side of inner tube contains insets to snap fit to the electrolyzer body. Top side of inner tube contains insets to rest PV panels.
* LID_FINAL_12_19 -- Lid of the electrolyzer, designed to fit snugly into the top of the main body. Contains slots to feed mesh cathode through -- Once the cathode is in place, it will need to be sealed in with epoxy to maintain gas tight barrier for the collection of accumulated gas inside the lid. Lid also contains a top port which can be fitted with a septum typically used for 5 mm NMR tubes.
* PANEL_HOLDER_12_19 -- Holding container for individual PV panel (Sundance Solar, rated at 3V 70 mA, SKU 700-10850-17). PV panel gently force fits into the panel holder. Panel holder then snap fits into the inner tube.
* PANEL_HOLDER_MIRROR_12_19 -- Modified panel holder which can be more convenient for wiring the PV panel to the mesh electrode pair, depending on how the system is wired and configured.

ADDITIONAL PARTS REQUIRED:
* Epoxy
* Glass microscope slides
* Titanium mesh electrodes coated with platinum or other electrocatalyst
* 4 PV panels (Sundance Solar, rated at 3V 70 mA, SKU 700-10850-17)
* 5 mm NMR tube septum
