OVERVIEW: Two glass microscope slides (76.2 mm x 25.4 mm x 1 mm) are epoxied (J.B. Weld) to the front and back of the device to allow backlighting during in situ high speed video measurements.

MAIN PART DESCRIPTION:
* Parallel Plate 4 mm Cell - Flow cell containing slits for two electrodes. The channel width is 4 mm. Two glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device to allow backlighting.
* Parallel Plate 2 mm Cell - Flow cell containing slits for two electrodes. The channel width is 2 mm. Two glass windows must be epoxied to the front and back of the device to allow backlighting.

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS REQUIRED:
* Epoxy
* Two glass microscope slides
* Pt/Titanium foil electrodes

ASSEMBLY:
1) Print out the cell with 4 mm or 2 mm channel width
2) Bend the two rectangular Pt/Ti electrodes to an angle of 135Â° at a length of 0.90 cm and slide them into slits on both sides of the cell before being epoxied in place
3) Epoxy the glass windows to the front and back of the device
